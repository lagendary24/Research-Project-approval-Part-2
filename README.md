***What’s the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?.***
“A minimum viable product has just enough core features to effectively deploy the product, and no more.” – Wikipedia

Now that the team and the challenge are well defined, it is time to create a specification for the first version of your software. This is important because it is an opportunity to get the scope of the project right. If a project is too small in scope, it does not serve as an opportunity to expand your technical understanding, or present as impressive. When a project is too large in scope, the project will likely be incomplete by the end of the 2 weeks.

**Some things to think about.**
User Experience
Remember that one of the most important users to consider will be the recruiter and hiring manager that will be evaluating your work. It may be helpful to think through a user experience that can be accessed without creating an account or giving personal details.

**Scope.**
For this project, consider that it is better to end up with something a bit smaller in scope that has undergone a couple (or at least one) iteration of deployment, testing and bug fixes. Documentation is also a big bonus!

**Shortcuts.**
It is fine to find ways to speed up development by taking shortcuts, but it’s important to state these openly, and have a plan in place to amend these if there is time. An example might be to first read and write from files without using a database (as you did with Airbnb at first), or hard-coding some values. This might be a good strategy if the real challenge of your software lies elsewhere, and you want to first create an end-to-end proof of concept to demonstrate feasibility.
